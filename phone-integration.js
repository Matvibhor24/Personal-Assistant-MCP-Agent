/**
 * Implementation Notes:
 * 
 * For Android:
 * - Termux (https://termux.com/) with Termux:API can provide access to some phone features
 * - You could develop a custom Android app that exposes a REST API to interact with phone resources
 * 
 * For iOS:
 * - You may need to develop a custom iOS app that exposes APIs for this NodeJS application
 * - Shortcuts and Automation features might also be leveraged
 * 
 * Cross-Platform Options:
 * - React Native or Flutter apps could be developed to bridge between this agent and phone features
 * - A dedicated mobile app could communicate with this server via WebSockets or REST
